# Day 1 - Setting Up Development Environment

**Date:** January 8, 2025

## Today's Progress

âœ… Set up GitHub repository for tracking my journey
âœ… Configured VS Code with essential extensions
âœ… Installed Node.js, Python, and Docker
âœ… Created my first "Hello World" in three languages

## Thoughts

Starting this 100 Days of Code challenge feels both exciting and daunting. Today was mostly about preparation, but I believe having a solid foundation is crucial. The GitHub journal setup will help me document everything I learn.

## What I Learned

- GitHub can be used as a powerful learning journal
- Markdown is more versatile than I initially thought
- Setting up a proper development environment saves time later

## Code Snippets

```javascript
// JavaScript Hello World with a twist
const greet = (name = 'World') => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Day 1 of 100 ðŸš€`);
};

greet('100 Days of Code');
```

```python
# Python version
def greet(name="World", day=1):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Day {day} of 100 ðŸš€")

greet("100 Days of Code", 1)
```

```bash
# Bash version
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, 100 Days of Code! Day 1 of 100 ðŸš€"
```
