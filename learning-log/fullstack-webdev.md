üéØ **This Week:** JavaScript ES6+ features

- Promises and async/await

## Notes & Key Concepts

### JavaScript Closures
```javascript
function outerFunction(x) {
  return function innerFunction(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}

const addFive = outerFunction(5);
console.log(addFive(3)); // 8
```
**Key Insight:** Inner functions have access to outer function's variables even after the outer function returns.

### CSS Grid vs Flexbox
- **Use Flexbox:** One-dimensional layouts (rows OR columns)
- **Use Grid:** Two-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns)

## Reflections

**Week 1:** The basics are more important than I thought. Spending extra time on fundamentals is paying off.

**Week 2:** CSS is not as simple as it seems. Grid and Flexbox are game-changers for layouts.
